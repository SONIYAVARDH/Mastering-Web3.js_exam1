ans.1)-                       Web3.js vs Ether.js
web3.js and ether.js are both ethereum JavaScript libraries.
web3.js is developed and maintained by the ethereum foundation. so there is wider support for web3.js as more developers are behind it.
Ether.js is developed and maintained by Rick Moore-A Canadian developer.
one major difference between Ether.js and Web3.js is how they handle key management and interation with the Ethereum Blockchain.
Web3.js assumes that there is a local node connect to the applicaion.it's assumed that the node to store keys,signs transactions,and reads and interacts with the Ethereum Blockchain.
In reality, this is not often the case most users are not running geth locally.
Metamask effectively emulate that environment through a browser application,so most web3 apps require.
Metamask to hold keys, sign transaction,and interact with the Ethereum mainnet.

on the other hand,Ether.js takes a different apporach that we belive gives developer more flexibility.
Ether.js separates the "Node" into two separate roles:
1. a "Wallet" that holds keys and signs transaction, and
2. a "provider" that serves as an anonymous connection to the Ethereum network ,checking state and sending transactions.
